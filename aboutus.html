                hen a user logs into your website, not matter on which web page he visits after logging in, his credentials will be with the server, until he logs out. 
                So this is managed by creating a session.
                The basic concept behind session is, whenever a user starts using our application, we can save a unique identification information about him, in an object which is available throughout the application, until its destroyed.
                This means when the user makes a new request for a page, he does not have to identify himself (everytime) again since his credentials are already stored in the server. 
                In short, This tells the server about us, urls visited, and  preferences, then the server determines what it should  show us or gives us more information on our stated preferences.
                This in summary or short lines means that the ServletContextEvent notifies the ServletContextListener about changes to the Servlet Context, that is tells the ServletContextListener that the Servlet Context has been initialized or it has been destroyed.
